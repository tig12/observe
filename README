Observe program is a small generic tool to execute commands.
Based on yaml command files, containing the commands and their parameters.

Unstable draft, under construction

Developed to analyze files containing mother - father - child birth data
- Births in France of year 2000 (N = 591 936).
- Gauquelin heredity data (N = 20 916)

Current commands implemented :
- convertFile   : clean the input and have standard formats
                  Start with 3 columns
- computeAstro  : compute the ecliptic longitudes of the planets at mother, father, child birth day (takes 12:00 UT)
                  (11 planets => 33 columns)
- aspects       : For each couple (Mother Child, Father Child, Mother Father), compute angular distance between planets.
                  Ex : compute distance between mother's sun and child's sun.
                  This makes 11 x 11 x 3 = 363 columns
- group         : Group the angular distances by degree (0 - 360)
- view.pages    : Generate html pages containing svg bar charts
                  3 pages with 121 drawings.
